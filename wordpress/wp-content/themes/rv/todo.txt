This file is just a list of to-dos for the build log:
-The RV theme has yet to be tested with a sufficient numbenr of posts to trigger pagination
--Be sure to check both the home page and category pages in this way
-Still need to consider and work out a way to handle images in posts
--Probably end up using Lightbox or some such for thumbnail lists...maybe...
-Need to hash out plugin for handling hour logging
-RSS link
